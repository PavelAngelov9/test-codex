# Test Codex

This project now includes a very simple Belote card game implemented with React. You play against three bot opponents.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server (using Vite) and open the game in your browser.

## Gameplay

- Four players take turns playing cards.
- Click a card in your hand to play it.
- Bots automatically choose a legal card to play.
- Highest card in the lead suit wins each trick.
- Cards are displayed with suit colors and card-like visuals.
- Simple announce controls let you check for Belote, All Koz, or Without Koz.
